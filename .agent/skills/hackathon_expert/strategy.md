# 🎯 Strategy Document

Project: AntiGravity – Predictive Last-Mile Reliability System
Event: Krackathon 2026

---

# 1. Strategic Objective

Win the hackathon by delivering a focused, high-impact digital utility that reduces commuter stress for Malaysian public transport users.

We will win through:

- Clear problem definition
- Quantifiable measurable impact
- Clean and stable demo
- Strong narrative framing

---

# 2. Core Problem Statement

Malaysian students and urban commuters experience daily stress due to:

1. Unreliable feeder bus arrival times
2. Heat exposure while waiting
3. Uncertainty in departure timing
4. Lack of informed decision support

This creates:

- Wasted time
- Physical discomfort
- Reduced trust in public transport
- Increased ride-hailing fallback behavior

We are solving uncertainty, not transport infrastructure.

---

# 3. Positioning

We are NOT building:

- Another bus tracking app
- Another map app
- Another generic transport dashboard

We ARE building:

A Predictive Commuter Reliability Engine that reduces stress and improves decision-making.

---

# 4. Target User

Primary:

- University students in urban Malaysia
- Heavy feeder bus users
- Heat-exposed commuters

Secondary:

- Daily M40 commuters
- Urban office workers

We optimize for one high-friction commuter route in demo.

---

# 5. Core Value Proposition

Instead of showing:

“Bus arrives in 7 minutes”

We show:

- Reliability %
- Delay risk
- Heat exposure risk
- Recommended departure timing
- Commuter Stress Score

We turn passive tracking into active decision support.

---

# 6. Measurable Impact (Winning Factor)

We must show:

- Total minutes saved
- Total heat exposure avoided
- Average reliability improvement
- Stress score reduction %

Judges must see numbers.

If it cannot be measured, it does not exist.

---

# 7. Demo Strategy

Demo must:

1. Show one live route
2. Simulate delay variation
3. Display stress score change
4. Show recommendation adjustment
5. Display community impact totals

Demo must never depend on unstable external APIs.

Preload sample data if needed.

Stability > Real-time purity.

---

# 8. Competitive Strategy

Other teams may:

- Overuse AI buzzwords
- Build overly broad systems
- Attempt national-scale solutions

We will:

- Focus deeply on one friction loop
- Deliver clean execution
- Present controlled sophistication

We win with clarity.

---

# 9. Risk Management

Risks:

- Real-time data instability
- Overengineering
- UI complexity
- Time overrun

Mitigation:

- Pre-seeded data
- Narrow scope
- Feature freeze early
- Polish over expansion

---

# 10. Winning Criteria

We succeed if judges say:

“This feels like a real utility that could actually be used.”

Not:

“This is technically interesting.”

Real utility beats technical complexity.

End of strategy.
